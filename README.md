#### Contribution guide: 

* Please use [CSS variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/--*) in the `looaders/vars.css` file. Make sure the custom measurements in your loader is related to the values in the vars file. Use [calc](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/calc) if necessary.

* Please make sure the folder name in the `loaders` folder, the css file name and the class name is the same. This is **Important** for the automatic defination loading to work.
